## Random Spellcard Name Generator ##
This is a little project of mine that will generate spellcard names. Although it's mainly for fun, I may expand it/contort it.

Note that the 'sign' portion of the spell name is random - 'Dream Sign' has the same likelihood of appearing that 'Light Spirit' has.

To compile:

make

To run:

./generator
